Summary Table:
Character Position	Meaning
1	File type
2-4	Owner permissions
5-7	Group permissions
8-10	Others (world) permissions
Additional Notes:

    Permissions are represented numerically as well:
        r = 4, w = 2, x = 1, - = 0
        So rw- translates to 4+2=6.
        This file would have permissions 664 (Owner: 6, Group: 6, Others: 4).
